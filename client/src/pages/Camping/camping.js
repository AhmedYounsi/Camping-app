                    <h1>Why Camping !?</h1>
                </ListGroup.Item>
<p>Most people go on camping trips because they're tired of the city or ready for an adventure.
    Whether you enjoy biking, hunting or any other outdoor activity, camping offers you a way to focus 
    completely on a hobby for a few days without external distractions.
    What you might not realize is that camping can help you live a longer, healthier life.
    If you regularly camp out, you'll enjoy dozens of significant health benefits from:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p>1. THE FRESH AIR
    When you spend time near a lot of trees, you take in more oxygen.
    That feeling of happiness that you get when you take your first breath of air at the campground
    isn't all in your head--well, technically it is, but it's a release of serotonin from the extra oxygen
    . Your body can function with less strain when there's plenty of oxygen. That's not the only benefit
    of fresh air. Research shows that some time outdoors can improve your blood pressure, 
    improve digestion and give your immune system an extra boost. When you spend a few days outside, 
    you get some serious health benefits from the extra oxygen and low levels of pollutants.
</p></li>
<li><a>2. SOCIALIZATION
Camping alone is plenty of fun, but if you bring along a friend or family member, you'll enjoy a
 unique experience together that will help you keep a healthy, happy relationship. Socializing can 
 extend your lifespan and delay memory problems according to research published in the American Journal
  of Public Health, and apart from the medical benefits, a few close relationships make life more fun.
   Invite a few friends on your next trip out.</a></li>


<li><a>3. IMPROVED MOODS
Regular campers will often talk about how the first few days back from a trip seem happier. This isn't
 without merit; spending some time outside in the sunlight can even out the levels of melatonin in your
  brain. Melatonin is the chemical that makes you feel tired and can induce feelings of depression, so by
   camping, you can enjoy better overall moods during and after your trip.
</a></li>

<li><a>4. LESS STRESS Camping also allows you to cope with stress. Stress can negatively affect your 
    health in just about every way possible, and you're putting much less strain on your mental and 
    physical faculties by giving yourself some stress-free time at the campsite. The lack of stress is 
    related to the rise in oxygen levels, higher levels of serotonin and managed levels of melatonin 
    mentioned above. There's also an emotional component at work here, since it's harder to be annoyed
     or angry when you're doing something that you enjoy.
</a></li>

<li><a>5. EXERCISE
Let's not forget the most obvious benefit of camping: you're spending a lot of time performing physical
 activities. Even if you're taking a fishing trip, you're burning more calories than you'd burn sitting 
 around an office, and if you hike or bike, you're performing cardiovascular exercise that will help keep 
 your heart and lungs healthy. Your activity levels will vary, but hikers burn anywhere from 120-300
  calories per hour. Bikers burn 300-500 calories per hour, and fly fishing can burn up to 200 calories 
  per hour. No wonder you work up such an appetite during a long camping trip.
</a></li>

<li><a>6. SUNSHINE
Sunshine feels great on your skin, and there's an evolutionary reason for that. 
When you're out in direct sunlight, you're taking on a ton of Vitamin D, 
which allows your body to absorb calcium and phosphorous.</a></li>

<li><a>8. GOOD FOOD
If you pack s'mores, you're not seeing any particularly solid health benefits in this department.
 However, if you're fond of fishing and hunting, you'll likely eat a large amount of protein and healthy 
 fats on your camping trip. You won't get any preservatives or unnatural ingredients in a fresh
  lake-caught fish, and all of the exercise on your trip will help you digest.
</a></li>

<li><a>9. NEW CHALLENGES
No two camping trips are exactly the same, and that's a good thing. Studies from the University of 
Texas and University of Michigan show that new experiences help to keep brains healthy. New activities
 that are both physically and intellectually
 stimulating have the greatest effect on brain health, and camping fits both of these criteria.</a></li>

<li><a>10. MEDITATION
When you go camping, don't forget to turn off your cell phone.
 Leave the tablet and the laptop computer at home. Try to disconnect for a few days and enjoy 
 the simplicity of the natural experience. This isn't just a general tip to help you enjoy the
  experience; if you're willing to enjoy your surroundings without any outside distractions, you
   could increase your lifespan. Jon Kabat-Zinn, founder of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction 
   Program, believes that turning off the cell phone and engaging with nature is one of the simplest 
   ways to get the health benefits of meditation. The Mayo Clinic reports that meditation may improve 
   a number of serious medical conditions by increasing self awareness and giving a person 
   stress-reduction tools. If you suffer from depression, fatigue, heart disease or even allergies, 
   research shows that camping can improve your overall health. Just don't forget to commit to
    the experience--if your cell phone's off, you're on your way to developing a stimulating, 
tranquil hobby that will keep you healthy for years to come.</a></li>
